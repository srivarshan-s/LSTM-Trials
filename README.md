# LSTM-Trials

### INFO
This project shows the usage of LSTM in two different activities:
1. Time series prediction
2. Text generation <a/>
The 1st activity is done in the time-series-prediction.ipynb file.<br/>
The 2nd activity is preformed in two ways: Python notebook and Python script.


### RUN
1. Put the training data in an accessible directory
2. Run train.py and provide the path to the training data
3. Provide the directory to save the weights
4. Run run.py and provide the path to the training data
5. Provide the path to the saved weights

### TODO
1. Improve accuracy of LSTM model
2. Append the output to a text file
